Approach

The `findString` function checks for the presence of a user-input string in a 6x5 character array.
It populates the array with random alphabetic characters and appends my student IDâ€™s last four digits in the last row. 
The program calculates the score based on whether the searched string is found, incrementing it for a successful search and decrementing it otherwise.

Lessons Learned
This problem taught me how to manage string inputs effectively and manipulate multidimensional arrays.
I also gained insight into searching algorithms and their implementation in C.
