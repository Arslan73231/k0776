Approach

To solve this problem, I implemented a function that checks whether the total number of matchsticks is a multiple of 5. 
If it is, it indicates a losing position for A; hence, the function returns -1. If not, A should pick the remainder of the 
total matches when divided by 5 to ensure a winning strategy.

Lessons Learned

By solving this problem, I learned how to implement a strategy for a simple game using modular arithmetic.
Additionally, I understood the importance of evaluating game states to determine winning and losing positions.
