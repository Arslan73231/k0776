Approach

The program uses a 5x5 grid to represent the game environment. The `moveUpDown` and `moveLeftRight` functions handle player movement and item collection.
The grid is displayed after each move, and the game continues until the player decides to quit.

Lessons Learned

This project taught me how to effectively manage user input and work with multidimensional arrays in C. 
It also enhanced my understanding of game mechanics and player interactions.
