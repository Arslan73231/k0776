Challenges Faced

While working on Assignment 2, I encountered several challenges:
- Ensuring my code output was unique to avoid similarity detection.
- Structuring the program to handle both horizontal and vertical histogram outputs effectively.

  Horizontal Histogram

Approach
The program reads values from the user and displays each as a line of asterisks representing the value's magnitude.
