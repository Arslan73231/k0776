Challenges Faced

While working on Assignment 2, I encountered several challenges:

Ensuring my code output was unique to avoid similarity detection.
Structuring the program to handle both horizontal and vertical histogram outputs effectively.

Approach

The program reads values from the user and displays each as a line of asterisks representing the value's magnitude.
